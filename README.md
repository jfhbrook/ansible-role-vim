# Ansible Role Vim

An Ansible role to install Vim and plugins on Linux and macOS.

This is a friendly fork of [ctorgalson/ansible-role-vim](https://github.com/ctorgalson/ansible-role-vim),
which has by far my favorite architecturally out of the vim roles I've seen.
That said, I've made a number of patches:

- (bugfix) Drop curly braces in `when` statement
- Allow setting the plugin name
- Only check before continuing if version check was run (allows --check mode)
- Option to `become` when installing packages

---

This role uses Vim 8's native package manager (see `:help packages`), so roles
will be installed by default to the following locations:

- `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/start`
- `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/opt`

Note that, unlike Pathogen or other Vim plugin managers, Vim's native package
management does **not** automatically create helptags. This role expects to
**be** the package manager (i.e. it expects to be run every time a plugin is
added or removed), and so manages helptag creation.

If your use case doesn't involve using the role for _all_ Vim plugin management,
you'll need to manage helptags using a method like one of the following:

- run `:helptags ALL` from inside Vim,
- script it (on cron or another trigger like [Git hooks](https://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html))
  something like this role does it: `vim -c 'helptags ~/.vim/pack' -c q`

## Requirements

The role has no special requirements, but Vim package management only
works with Vim > 8.0, so it's necessary to ensure that a sufficiently
recent version of Vim is either present, or will be installed by setting
the `vim_installed_packages` variable appropriately.

## Role Variables

The following variables are used in the role. See also Example Playbook
(below) and `molecule/default/playbook.yml` for specific examples.

| Variable name | Default value | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `vim_become` | `false` | Whether to `become` when installing packages. |
| `vim_installed_packages`      | `["vim"]`         | A list of packages to install (passed to Ansible's Package module). |
| `vim_removed_packages`        | `[]`              | A list of packages to remove (e.g. on Ubuntu, it might be preferable to remove `vim-tiny`). |
| `vim_owner`                   | `""`              | The system user to install Vim and/or associated plugins for. |
| `vim_pack_subdirectory`       | `ansible-managed` | The name of the directory to place plugins installed by this role into the default creates e.g. `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/start` and `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/opt`. |
| `vim_installed_plugins`       | `[]`              | The list of plugins to install to `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/start`--see `:help packages` for details on what this means. Should contain a `repo` property, a `type` property set to either 'start' or 'opt', and (optionally) a `version` property as used by Ansible's Git module. |
| `vim_removed_plugins`         | `[]`              | A list of plugins to remove from `~/.vim/pack/ansible-managed/{opt,start}`. Each should contain a directory property set to the directory name of the plugin, and a `type` property set to either 'start' or 'opt'. |
| `vim_dotfiles`                | `[]`              | A list of local vim-related dotfiles to install to `~/`. |
